# UniTime-HCMUS

UniTime-HCMUS is the browser-based version of the original SchedulerRaylibHCMUS project.
It helps HCMUS students browse available courses, build a personal timetable, and manage schedules with JSON import/export.

## Core Idea

- Keep the SchedulerRaylibHCMUS scheduling logic, but run it in a web app.
- Read available course data directly from the root resources folder.
- Let users select courses visually and store their timetable in local storage.

Original desktop project:

- https://github.com/hongphuchcmus/SchedulerRaylibHCMUS

## Features

- Browse and search available courses.
- Add and remove classes from your timetable.
- Detect schedule conflicts and enforce per-day limits.
- Persist schedule automatically in browser local storage.
- Export your current schedule as JSON.
- Import a saved schedule JSON file.

## Data Source

The web app reads available classes from: resources/extracted_table.json

## Run Locally (JavaScript Only)

Requirements:

- Node.js 18+

Start server:

1. Open terminal at the project root.
2. Run:

The Node server serves:
